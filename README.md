# HarmonyOS-Watch-Network-Speed-Test-Demo

Introduction:
This demo shows how to call an API on your watch to obtain health data such as heart rate and step count. Working with a distributed health mobile app, you can browse data across devices and notify you of abnormal heart rates

Installation requirements:
Install Huawei DevEco Studio and set up the DevEco Studio development environment. The DevEco Studio development environment needs to depend on the network environment. It needs to be connected to the network to ensure the normal use of the tool.The development environment can be configured according to the following two situations: 1) If you can directly access the Internet, just download the HarmonyOS SDK; 2) If the network cannot access the Internet directly, it can be accessed through a proxy server • Generate secret key and apply for certificate

User guide: 
Download this Project and open DevEco Studio, click File> Open> Then select and open this Project • Click Build> Build App(s)/Hap(s)>Build Debug Hap(s) to compile the hap package.  Then Click Run> Run 'entry' to run the hap package.
Note that you can choose to run the hap package on the simulator or the Huawei watch 3. If you run it on the watch, you need to configure the signature and certificate information in the project's File> Project Structure> Modules> Signing Configs.
